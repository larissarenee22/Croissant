    <h1>🥐 Croissant 🥐</h1>
    <p>
      When you think about a fresh, flaky croissant, you probably conjure up
      images of Paris. A lazy morning on the Left Bank, a small round table,
      reading Le Journal with a steamy cup of café au lait, and of course, that
      croissant. That warm, buttery croissant. Crispy on the outside, light and
      fluffy on the inside. Enjoyable on all sides and in every way imaginable.
      Now, ask yourself where it’s from. Go deep. Go beyond the simple answer of
      “the little bakery around the corner” and search for the origin, the true
      birthplace of that oh-so-famous French delicacy. We’re sorry to do this to
      you, but we’re going to get right to it. That croissant you’re enjoying as
      you lovingly stare at the Tour Eiffel? It’s not French.
